title: Well
name: well
category: layout
---
Use the `well` class on `<div>`s or `<aside>`s to apply the visual cue of ancillary content.

```html_example
<aside class="well">
    <h3>Ao (青) vs. Midori (緑)</h3>
    <p>
        Midori is a Japanese word for green, although its boundaries are not the same as in English.
        Ancient Japanese did not have this distinction: the word midori only came into use in the
        Heian period, and at that time (and for a long time thereafter) midori was still considered
        a shade of ao.
    </p>
</aside>
```

If you add a `<header>` or `<footer>` inside the `well`, they will be visually separated from
the content.

```html_example
<aside class="well">
    <header>
        <h3>Trivia</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
        Educational materials distinguishing green and blue only came into use after World War II,
        during the Occupation: thus, even though most Japanese consider them to be green,  the word
        ao is still used to describe certain vegetables, apples and vegetation.
    </p>
</aside>

The `well-small` modifier class reduces the padding and borders of the well.

```html_example
<aside class="well well-small">
    <h3>Ao (青) vs. Midori (緑)</h3>
    <p>
        Midori is a Japanese word for green, although its boundaries are not the same as in English.
